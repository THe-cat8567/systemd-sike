## systemd-sike

lil init written in POSIX sh

systemd-sike - init program
bootup - bootup script (/etc/bootup, modify as needed)
shutdown - shutdown script (/etc/shutdown, modify as needed)
rescue - rescue script (set this as the init= to have a rescue enviroment)
the-real-halt.c (compile and place in $PATH)

shutdown does not work if there are libvirt services or Xorg is running
no idea why

check the repo `dameontools-encore-extras` for services and helpers to manage services and oneshots

the version naming scheme is supposed to work with my package manager project "localpkg"
so thats why its only a single number

i do not actually use this as my primary init, the point of this project was mostly educational
and for fun not as a actual practical init

NOTE: the code for the-real-halt.c is from:
https://github.com/cemkeylan/shinit#note-on-halting-the-system
