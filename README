## systemd-sike

lil init written in POSIX sh

systemd-sike - init program
bootup - bootup script (/etc/bootup, modify as needed)
shutdown - shutdown script (/etc/shutdown, modify as needed)
rescue - rescue script (set this as the init= to have a rescue enviroment)
the-real-hal.c (compile and place in $PATH)

shutdown does not work if there are libvirt services or Xorg is running
no idea why
